Task 6 Next Steps:-
Fine-tuning: Further tune hyperparameters of Random Forest for potential performance improvement.
Validation: Use cross-validation to assess the model's generalization performance.
Ensemble Methods: Explore ensemble methods like model stacking or boosting for potential improvements.
Interpretation: If model interpretability is crucial, consider Logistic Regression, but be aware that it may sacrifice some predictive performance.
